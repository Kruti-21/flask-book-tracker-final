#### A webapp made using **Flask** and **HTML, CSS & JavaScipt** to track book reading progress. ####

A simple webapp that book lovers can use to keep track of their books as well as to stay motivated to finish reading an ongoing book. The users can start reading again right from where they left.

Multiple books can be tracked at the same time. The user can update the progress by changing the number of pages read. Books are automatically marked as completed when the number of pages read becomes equal to total number of pages in the book.
